What to run to regenerate PSSH2

1.	Make sure the pdb and uniprot tables on the Aquaria MySQL on AWS have been updated.
2.	Use the Autoscaling group "submitToQueue_pdbFull_startByHand" to start an instance
2.1	Log in to the instance
2.2 Edit /home/ec2-user/pssh2.aws.conf to update 
      dbDate and (if necessary)
      aquaria_name
      u20 (if the uniclust30 has changed, 
           don't foreget to also update the table database_status if this has changed!)
    and upload to S3: 
	REGION=`wget -q 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone -O- | sed 's/.$//'`; aws --region=$REGION  s3 cp /home/ec2-user/pssh2.aws.conf s3://pssh3cache/private_config/
2.3 `source /home/ec2-user/pssh2.aws.conf` OR set dbDate to the new date (`dbDate=...)
2.4 `export dbDate`
2.4	Start submitting: `./startProcesses.sh`
3.	Old: Use the Autoscaling group "build_structure_profiles_group" to start instances
	New: Use the LaunchTemplate "build_structure_profiles_noDebug" to start spot instances
		Autoscaling doesn't work at the moment, 
		so just use "Create Spot Fleet" not with the "maintain" option, monitor yourself,
		remember to cap the price
	UPDATE (2019): 
		Autoscaling works again -> use Autoscaling "build_structure_profiles_group_r" 
			(based on LaunchTemplate "build_structure_profiles_noDebug"")
		HHblits uses too much memory for m instances, we need r
		larger instances are more expensive but need fewer EBS volumes	
3.1 When Autoscaling group has finished (scaled back to a handfull of instances)
    log into the instances and:
    	kill the processes
    	add lines to config:
    	echo 'build_normal_queue="build_hhblits_structure_profiles_bigJobs"' >> $conf_file
    	echo 'build_long_queue="build_hhblits_structure_profiles_failed"' >> $conf_file
		modify startProcesses to launch fewer concurrent jobs
		restart startProcesses.sh
4. Use the LaunchTemplate "build_pdb_full_40ct_200G" to start an instance for assembling the pdb_full database
